/*
 *
 * Implementation file.
 * A very simple yet powerful implementation of Vigen√®re's and Ceaser's cipher.
 * This program is able to cipher and decipher Caesar's and Vigenere's ciphers
 * as well as to crack Caesar's cipher (by testing all 26 alphabets) very
 * quickly. This has been possible by passing values by reference to functions
 * (i.e. memory addresses not values). Input could be any arbitrary length string.
 * If the string contains spaces then it must be surrounded by double quotations
 * : ' " '.
 * The key as well as the string characters must be 7 bit ASCII. The only
 * working range is: [a-z,A-Z]. Characters included in this range are
 * guaranteed to work. The space character (ASCII 32) for example will not be
 * translated along with the working range characters. It will just stay there.
 * The key has another condition: it must not contain spaces.
